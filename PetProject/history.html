		<h5>Evolution and Regrowth of Fauna</h5>
		<p id="p1">Australia as a continent has had a very hot and dry climate for a very long time leading bushfires to be so common that many Australian plants have evolved to adapt to these conditions. Many plant actually use bushfires to help them spread their seeds or propogate new plants. Some plants even have evolved to contain oils that encourage fires, which they can easily recover from but will perhaps eliminate plants in competition for resources. While initially detrimental to much of the plant life, the remenants of burned plants enrich the soil greatly to promote future growth.</p>

		<h5>Traditional Bushfire Control</h5>
		<p id="p2">Aboriginal people of Australia constantly used fire as a way to maintain the land long before the arrival of Europeans. Bushfires were intentionally lit to clear areas for agriculture, or create breaks to prevent areas that they did not want to burn from burning when uncontrolled fires occurred in the dry season. When Europeans began cultivating the land, disaster soon followed as they did not maintain the traditional burning practices exercised for thousands of years by the Aboriginal people. Today controlled burns are again common in Australia as a way to prevent bushfires from becoming uncontrolled when conditions worsen.</p>

		<h5>Toll of Bushfires</h5>
		<p id="p3">Although bushfires in some instances can have positive effects on local flora, they can also be incredibly destructive. Since the late 1800s around 800 people have lost their lives to bushfires in Australia along with billions of animals and billions of dollars worth of damage to property and livestock. Some notable fire events in the past include Black Friday in summer of 1939, Black Tuesday in 1967, the 1993/1994 fire season, Black Saturday in 2009, and most recently the devastating 2019/2020 fire season. The most recent fire season was especially prolonged and damaging, causing damage and devestation that is still being accounted for.</p>
