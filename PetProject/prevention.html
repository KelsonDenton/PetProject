		<h4>Preparing your house</h4>
		<p>If you live in a high bushfire risk area, it is very important to ensure you maintain proprer upkeep and always have a plan in the event of a fire. Make a fire escape plan with a meeting point and routes to make a safe exit. Ensure the route is always clear of debris and every member of the household is well aware of the plan.</p>
		<p>It is also vital to maintain your house constantly. This can be done by regularly clearing gutters of debris such as leaves and branches, and making sure that any overhanging branches are cut well back from the structure so they do not pose a danger if they were to fall. Gutters are essential to maintain as one ember landing in a gutter filled with debris can cause an entire house to burn.</p>
		<p>In extremly high risk areas a fire unit should be kept on the premises. This fire unit should be checked for leaks and fullness extremely regularly during hot months, and the motor should also be checkd and always filled with fuel. Practice using the fire unit regularly as well to minimize time spent fumbling around in the event of a fire.</p>

		<h3>Ready at all times</h3>
		<p>Although some bushfires are started by human activity such as moving machinery, campfires, cigarette butts, or unfortunatly arsonists, many are started naturally as well. This can be through lightning strikes during hot dry periods with no rain. Because of this it means a bushfire may start near you no matter how careful you are. People who live in the bush or near the bush must always be prepared and have a plan. If a bushfire is to come to your area and you decide to defend your house, you must make sure you have ample water and are extremely prepared for what is to come. Preferably having some past experience with bushfires. Bushfires are extremely mentally and physically challenging, and taking one on should not be taken lightly. Anyone who is to stay must be ready to defend the house and know proper safety protocol.</p>
		<p>If you are going to leave the area in the event of a bushfire, it is imperiative you leave yourself enough time to get out. Preparing your house to weather a fire if you are gone is reccommended, but must be done well in advance of the arrival of the fire. If escape is left too long it may become impossible leaving you trapped. Having a planned escape route and a time frame in which you will leave or stay is imperative.</p>
		<p>Another way to be ready is to be in touch with local fire brigade and emergency crew. Find a way to stay updated on bushfire conditions in your area and check the updates frequently. Always listen to the advice of professionals. Not listening to advice properly can not only endanger your life but theirs as well.</p>
