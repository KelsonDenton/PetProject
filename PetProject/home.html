			<h3>What a bushfire is (according to GeoScience Australia):</h3>
			<blockquote>"Bushfires and grassfires are common throughout Australia. Grassfires are fast moving, passing in five to ten seconds and smouldering for minutes. They have a low to medium intensity and primarily damage crops, livestock and farming infrastructure, such as fences. Bushfires are generally slower moving, but have a higher heat output. This means they pass in two to five minutes, but they can smoulder for days. Fire in the crown of the tree canopy can move rapidly."</blockquote>

			<h3>What contributes to a bushfire:</h3>
			<p>There are many factors that contribute to the likelihood a bushfire will occur. The weather greatly influcences it with factors such as humidity, temperature, and windspeed impacting the day to day variation in chance of a fire occuring. Available fuel for the fire also is a factor, and the dryness or wetness of the fuel. Dry fuel, high ambient temperature, low humidity, and high windspeed all increase the chances of a bushfire occurring and becoming out of control.</p>

		<h3>Bushfire Facts</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bushfires move faster uphill than downhill</li>
			<li>Embers can cause bushfires to jump many kilometers at a time.</li>
			<li>When a fire is extreme enough it can create its own weather patters.</li>
			<li>Bushfires, though destructive, are part of the natural cycle of things in Australia.</li>
			<li>Bushfires occurr on overy continent except Antarctica.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Lorem Ipsum</h3>
		<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
		<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

		<tr>
			<th id="rating">Rating</th>
			<th id="meaning">What it means</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td headers="rating" id="lowRate">Low to Moderate</td>
			<td headers="meaning">Bushfires started in these conditions can generally be easily contained. These conditions generally result after a period of rain and/or low ambient temperatures. It is normally safe to have controlled fires under these conditions.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td headers="rating" id="highRate">High</td>
			<td headers="meaning">Generally bushfires started in these conditions can be fairly easily contained, but extra caution must be taken. Check to see if permits apply if undertaking any controlled burns.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td headers="rating" id="veryHighRate">Very High</td>
			<td headers="meaning">Conditions during a very hig rating are generally hot, dry and potentially windy. If a fire started under these conditions it may be difficult to contain. Preventative measures should be taken.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td headers="rating" id="severeRate">Severe</td>
			<td headers="meaning">Conditions are hot, dry, and windy. A fire started in these conditions would be very difficult to control and would spread very quickly and be unpretictable. People in the area should be prepared to act accordingly.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td headers="rating" id="extremeRate">Extreme</td>
			<td headers="meaning">These conditions are similar to the severe rating with increased winds, temperatures, and low humidity. People in the area should be on high alert and be ready to act and possibly leave. A bushfire would be incredibly difficult to bring under control.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td headers="rating" id="catastrophicRate">Catastrophic</td>
			<td headers="meaning">These conditions are extremely bad for bushfires, and come about after a prolonged period of hot, dry weather with high winds. People in the area should leave as a bushfire would be impossible to bring under control in these conditions.</td>
		</tr>
